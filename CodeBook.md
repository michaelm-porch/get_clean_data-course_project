This document provides information about the data generated by the script `run_analysis.R`, provided in this repository.

## Data
Function `CleanAndAggregateStudy` takes a single parameter `calculateAverages` - a boolean defaulted to TRUE - which indicates whether the resultant tidy data should be aggregated by Test Subject and Activity.

### Data set `StudyAveragesTidy.csv`

The dataset `StudyAveragesTidy.csv` was generated by cleaning and aggregating data from an experiment in which measurements were collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone used by 30 subjects carrying out a variety of 6 activities.
For your convenience we have included information about the original data in the section [Original data set](#original-data-set).

Here follows a description of what `StudyAveragesTidy.csv` looks like.

1. The first variable `Subject` identifies the test subject under measurement. There are 30 subjects total.
2. The second variable `Activity` defines the specific Activity involved in the measurement event. There are six Activities Total:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

Of the 561 variables in the original measurement data sets (`./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt` and `./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt`) only the 66 variables associated with the mean and standard deviation measurements are included. Additionally, the `"t"` & `"f"` prefixes were replaced by `"time_"` and `"freq_"` respectively.
Also instances of `"BodyBody"` has been simplified to `"Body"`.

A full description of the features is best obtained from the file `features_info.txt`, included with the original dataset (I found it unnecessary to duplicate all the information here).

### Data set `StudyAveragesTidy.csv`
The final transformation in the deliverable data set `StudyAveragesTidy.csv` involves grouping the Subject and Activity and then aggregating each row using the mean function. This yields 180 rows (30 subjects times 6 activities) comprised of 81 columns (Subject, Activity, and 79 distinct measurements).  

## Original data set
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
